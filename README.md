Daily Screen Time and Creative Productivity Analysis

Project Overview

This project investigates how daily screen time—spent across various digital activities such as gaming, social media, streaming services, and internet browsing—affects creative productivity, motivation, and overall creative quality. By tracking detailed screen usage patterns and daily creative output, the project aims to identify correlations and insights that can inform strategies for maximizing creative performance.

Objectives

Quantify the Impact: Clearly measure how daily screen time influences creativity and motivation levels.

Activity-Specific Analysis: Determine whether specific screen activities (e.g., gaming, social media, streaming) uniquely influence creativity positively or negatively.

Actionable Insights: Develop evidence-based guidelines to optimize screen time habits for improved creative productivity.

Motivation

Understanding the relationship between digital engagement and creativity is critical in an increasingly screen-dominated world. This project leverages data-driven insights to inform healthier digital habits and enhance personal creative output, thereby promoting more intentional technology use.

Dataset

Data collected daily over a three-month period:

Date: Specific day of the record

Total Screen Time: Hours spent across all screen-based activities daily

Activity Type Breakdown:

Gaming (hours/day)

Social Media (hours/day)

Streaming/TV series (hours/day)

Internet Browsing (hours/day)

Other Digital Activities (hours/day)

Creative Output Quality: Self-rated quality of creative work produced (scale of 1–10)

Motivation Level: Self-rated motivation to engage in creative tasks (scale of 1–10)

Creative Productivity: Number of creative tasks/projects worked on daily

Mental Fatigue Level: Self-rated mental tiredness after screen time (scale of 1–10)

Tools and Technologies

Python: Data processing and statistical analysis

Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning

Matplotlib and Seaborn: Visualization of trends and correlations

SciPy and Statsmodels: Hypothesis testing and regression analysis

Analysis Plan

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

Regular logging of daily screen time, creative productivity, and motivation ratings into a structured dataset.

Handling missing values, standardizing data, and detecting anomalies or outliers.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualizations:

Scatter plots to visualize relationships (e.g., total screen time vs. creative output quality).

Boxplots comparing the impact of specific screen activities on creativity.

Time-series analysis to identify weekly or monthly productivity cycles.

Correlation Matrix:

Heatmap of correlations among all variables.

3. Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis 1:

H₀: Total daily screen time has no significant effect on creative output or motivation.

Hₐ: Higher total daily screen time negatively impacts creative output and motivation.

Hypothesis 2:

H₀: Different screen-based activities equally impact creativity.

Hₐ: Certain activities (e.g., social media) negatively affect creativity more significantly compared to others (e.g., streaming or gaming).

Regression analysis to quantify relationships and identify significant predictors of creative productivity.

4. Actionable Recommendations

Provide guidelines based on findings (e.g., recommended daily limits for specific activities, ideal activity types for creativity boosts, optimal timing of screen engagement).

Potential Insights and Applications

Identification of optimal screen time duration and activities beneficial for creativity.

Strategies to balance digital entertainment with productive creative work.

Personal insights to refine and improve daily habits for sustained creative growth.

By the end of this project, clear, data-backed strategies will be developed to guide daily screen usage, optimizing creativity and motivation in a digitally integrated lifestyle.
