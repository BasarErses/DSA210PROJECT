## Optimizing Battery Efficiency Across Devices and Usage Patterns

### Project Overview
This project analyzes battery efficiency across devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones) during various computing tasks. By tracking battery life, CPU utilization, temperature, and brightness levels for tasks like gaming, video editing, streaming, coding, and idle states, it identifies optimal usage patterns to maximize battery life and performance.

### Objectives
- **Detailed Performance Analysis:** Evaluate how different tasks affect battery life.
- **Identify Optimal Usage Patterns:** Determine which tasks and devices yield the best battery efficiency.
- **Impact of User-Controlled Settings:** Analyze how brightness and task prioritization affect battery performance.
- **Provide Actionable Recommendations:** Offer practical, data-driven guidelines for extending battery life.
