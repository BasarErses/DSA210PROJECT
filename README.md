## 📚 Project Overview
This project explores how daily screen time—across activities such as gaming, social media, streaming services, and internet browsing—affects creative productivity, motivation, and the quality of creative output. By meticulously tracking and analyzing screen usage patterns alongside daily creative outcomes, the study seeks to provide actionable insights for optimizing creative performance.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. **Quantify the Impact**: Measure how daily screen time influences creativity and motivation.
2. **Activity-Specific Analysis**: Identify if particular screen activities uniquely affect creativity.
3. **Actionable Insights**: Establish evidence-based guidelines for optimizing digital habits to enhance creativity.

## 💡 Motivation
Understanding digital engagement's effect on creativity is crucial in today's screen-oriented society. This project aims to uncover practical strategies to manage digital interactions positively, ultimately boosting creative output.
